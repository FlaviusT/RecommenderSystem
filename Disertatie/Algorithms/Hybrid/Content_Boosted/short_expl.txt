Input:
	- a list of movies
	- a list of users
	- a list of ratings given by users;

Output:
	- as output we have a matrix that consist from each user on the x axis and each movie on the y axis;
	- the matrix contains all the ratings given by users, and, where the users have no ratings, the rating will be
	computed using the content-based algorithm(this is pseudo rating)
					
				- URx,y : where the user has given a rating;				
		Vx,y =
				- PRx,y: where the user has given no rating;
				
		Vx,y - the matrix of all the users with ratings to all movies;
		URx,y - if the user x rated the movie y, this rating will be written in the matrix;
		PRx,y - peudo-rating(computed by content-based algorithm) where user x has given no rating to the movie y
